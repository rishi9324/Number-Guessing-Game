# Project Description
A basic number guessing game for the web created with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. Guessing a number between 1 and 100 that is generated at random is the aim of the game. The number of attempts you made after making a right guess is displayed, and the game gives you feedback on how high or low your guess was.


# Characteristics
- User Interface : Bootstrap was used to create a responsive and user-friendly UI.
- Game Logic : JavaScript manages game logic, which includes feedback and random number generation.
- Input Handling : Assists with entering guesses by pressing the "Enter" key as well as clicking the "Submit" button.
- Intelligent Feedback : Presents alerts that change colour dynamically according to how accurate the guess was.


# How to Apply
- Start the Game : Launch your browser and navigate to the `index.html} file.
- Provide Your Estimate : Enter a number in the input area between 1 and 100.
- Submit Your Guess : Press the "Enter" key or click the "Submit" button.
- Get Feedback : The game will inform you if your estimate is accurate or too high or low.
- Start a New Game : The game will restart and initiate a new round immediately when you make a correct estimate.
